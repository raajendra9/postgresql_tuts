--what we want query to do is scan the weather table and for each row
--to find the matching cities rows. if no matching foudn we want some empty values
--to substitute cities's table columns. this kind of query is called an outer join

select * from weather left outer join cities on(weather.city = cities.name);

--this query is called left outer join because the the table mentioned on the left of the
--join operator will have each of its rows in the output atleast once
-- where as the table on the right will only have those rows output that match some rows of the left table.
--when ouputting a left table row for which there is no right table match

-- self join is a query in which table joined to itself. self joins useful for comparing values in a
-- column of rows with in the same table

	and w1.temo_hi > w2.temo_hi;

--aggregate functions 
-- An aggregate funcition computes a single result from multiple input rows
-- some are count, sum, avg, max and min
select max(temp_lo) from weather;

--if wanted to know which city that reading occured
select city from weather
    where temp_lo = (select max(temp_lo) from weather);

-- this is ok but subquery is an independent computation that 
-- computes ite own aggregate function separately from what is happening in outer query
-- aggregate is also useful with group by clause
-- we can get the maximum low temperature in each city with
select city, max(temp_lo)
    from weather
    group by city;

-- it gives one output from each city. each aggreagate result is computed over the table rows matching that city
-- we can filter these grouped rows using having clause

select city, max(temp_lo)
    from weather 
    group by city 
    having max(temp_lo) > 40;

-- if we only care about cities whose names begin with s
select city, max(temp_lo)
    from  weather 
    where city like 'S%' or city like 's%'
    group by city
    having max(temp_lo) > 40;

--suppose the the combined listing of weather records and city location is 
--particular interest to your application,but you do not want to type the query eah time
-- you need it, you can create a view over the query, which gives a name to the query that you can refer
